# Chalkboard Math - Swift UI

This Git repository is a complete rewrite in Swift and Swift UI of the iOS application Chalkboard Math (https://apps.apple.com/au/app/chalkboard-math/id542250586)

# License 

You are free to use the code (Swift and Objective-C) for any purpose - including commercial use - provided that you are not making an educational app or game that would be considered a competing app on the AppStore.

You are not permitted to use any images, audio files, or any other graphical assets including but not limited to the Chalkman character in any publicly released application, without prior consent of the copyright owner (22nd Century Software).  

If in doubt, please ask :-)   The goal here is to prevent somebody from just taking all the code, and then charging money if I want to make this app free for all to use on the Apple AppStore.

# Getting Started

1. Clone this git repository on your local machine

2. Install XCode 12.0 or later from Apple

3. Open ChalkboardMath-SwiftUI.xcodeproj and build/run

# Current State 

Application right now is just an empty Chalkboard.  Will be adding more functionality to the project, with the end goal being parity of what is currently on the App Store
